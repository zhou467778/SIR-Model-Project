NEU Math 5131 - Mathematical Modeling final project: Analysis for SARS Epidemic in Hongkong, China Using SIR Model

At the end of February 2003, a viral respiratory disease - severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was first identified and reported during an outbreak in China. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) introduces it as “a viral respiratory illness caused by a coronavirus called SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV)”. In addition, before its globe outbreak was contained in July 2003, it spread to several different countries in Asia, North America, South America, and Europe. And it became the first serious new disease in 21st century that can be easily transmitted. Fortunately, there have been no reported cases of SARS in the world since 2004.

In order to have a better understanding for the characteristics of infectious diseases, such as SARS, as well as predicting the future growth trend and helping inform public health interventions, the mathematical modelling of infectious diseases is needed.

To achieve this task, this project analyzes the 2003 SARS epidemic within Hongkong, China from
March 31st, 2003, to July 11th, 2003, using a published dataset on Kaggle. The reason for the selection of data is that China was under the most severe situation at that time, and data for Hongkong is more reliable, comparing with data for Mainland China and Taiwan. Moreover, the susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) model is used as the mathematical model in this project since SARS is an epidemic disease. The purpose of
this project is to analyze the SARS data and build the corresponding SIR model, to predict the trend of SARS in 2003. In this project, three models have been built, and only one of them performs well.
